# login_again

A simple login and welcome page.  The password is 'welcome' again.

I've uploaded two folders -- loginpage is the entire django project.  It contains a lot of .py files that are automatically generated when creating a new django project, but if you want to test my code, you'll need this whole directory.

If you're just interested in the code, all of the files that I edited for this task are in the /relevant directory.

To test the page, download /loginpage.  From the command line, cd into that directory, run "python manage.py runserver", then go here -- http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/
